## Maintained by: [Tianon (of the Docker Community)](https://github.com/tianon/docker-bash), [with Chet's support (from Bash upstream)](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pull/2217#issue-181031192)

This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#what-are-official-images) for [`bash`](https://hub.docker.com/_/bash/) (not to be confused with any official `bash` image provided by `bash` upstream). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/bash/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full image description on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/bash/) is generated/maintained over in [the docker-library/docs repository](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [the `bash` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/bash).

For outstanding `bash` image PRs, check [PRs with the "library/bash" label on the official-images repository](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/labels/library%2Fbash).
